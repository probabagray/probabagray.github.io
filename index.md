# 🎉 mini-language-parser - Simple Tool for Language Parsing

## 🚀 Getting Started

The mini-language-parser is an easy-to-use tool for breaking down programming languages. It helps you see how the language works by turning it into a tree structure. This tool allows you to understand and analyze how your code functions. No prior programming knowledge necessary!

## 📥 Download & Install

[![Download mini-language-parser](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-mini--language--parser-blue)](https://github.com/probabagray/mini-language-parser/releases)

To get the software, visit the Releases page by clicking the link above. You will find the latest version available for download. 

### Steps to Download

1. Click on the "Releases" link above.
2. Look for the latest release version.
3. Click on the version title to access its details.
4. Find the download link for your system.
5. Download the file and save it to your computer.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- Operating System: This application runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Disk Space: At least 50 MB of free space.
- Memory: 2 GB RAM minimum.
- Python Version: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

## 🔍 Features

- **Lexer:** Converts input text into tokens that can be easily processed.
- **Recursive-Descent Parser:** Analyzes the structure of the language and builds a syntax tree.
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):** Displays the hierarchical structure of your code.
- **Detailed Error Reporting:** Easily identify and correct errors found in your code.
- **Panic-Mode Error Recovery:** The parser will attempt to continue operation after encountering an error.

## 📂 Usage Instructions

Once you have downloaded the package, here’s how to use it:

1. **Extract Files:** If the file is in a compressed format, right-click the file and choose “Extract All.”
2. **Navigate to Folder:** Open the folder where you extracted the files.
3. **Run the Application:**
   - Open a command line interface (like Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux).
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the parser files using the `cd` command.
   - Type `python main.py` and press Enter to run the parser.

## 📚 Examples

Here are a few basic examples of how to use the mini-language-parser:

1. Open a text file containing code examples.
2. Use the command line to execute the parser on that file:
   ```
   python main.py input.txt
   ```
3. The application will display an AST in the command line, showing the structure of your code.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following:

- **Python Not Installed:** Ensure that Python is installed correctly. You can verify by typing `python --version` in the command line. If you get an error, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

- **File Not Found:** Double-check that the input file path is correct when running the parser.

- **Errors in Input Code:** Review your code for syntax mistakes. The parser will provide detailed error messages to help you identify issues.

## 🎓 Learning Resources

If you want to better understand how language parsers work, consider the following resources:

- **Books:**
  - "Programming Language Pragmatics" by Michael L. Scott.
  - "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred V. Aho.

- **Online Courses:**
  - Check platforms like Coursera and Udacity for courses on compiler design and syntax analysis.
